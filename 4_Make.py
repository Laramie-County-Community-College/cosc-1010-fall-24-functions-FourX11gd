Requirements:  Define four subroutines - add, subtract, multiply, divide that add multiply etc two numbers and return the result. Each should have two integer number arguments.
  The user is asked to input two numbers. These numbers will be passed as arguments into one of the subroutines.
  The user is asked to input 1 to add, 2 to subtract etc.
  If they input 1, call the ‘add’ subroutine, input 2 calls the ‘subtract’ subroutine etc
  Output the returned result as part of a sentence.

Variables:
  Inptus: Menu Inputes and Numerical Inputs
  Calculated:  Mathematical statements
  
Outputs:  Mathemeatcal statements, dynamic sentances

Key calculations:  Mathematical satements, Menu selections

Key design considerations:
  Ease of reading (formating)

Test data:
  I accidentally deleted the first program, but this one will have the same testing, multiple numbers to check the math
  Numbers to check menuing, including indicating a incorrect number and asking again
